This is the code repository for [Hands-On Simulation Modeling with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/hands-on-simulation-modeling-with-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838985097), published by Packt.

**Develop simulation models to get accurate results and enhance decision-making processes**

## What is this book about?
Simulation modeling helps you to create digital prototypes of physical models to analyze how they work and predict their performance in the real world. With this comprehensive guide, you'll understand various computational statistical simulations using Python.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Gain an overview of the different types of simulation models
* Get to grips with the concepts of randomness and data generation process
* Understand how to work with discrete and continuous distributions
* Work with Monte Carlo simulations to calculate a definite integral
* Find out how to simulate random walks using Markov chains

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import random
import statistics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Hands-On Simulation Modeling with Python is for simulation developers and engineers, model designers, and anyone already familiar with the basic computational methods that are used to study the behavior of systems. This book will help you explore advanced simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo methods, statistical simulations, and much more using Python. Working knowledge of Python programming language is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
